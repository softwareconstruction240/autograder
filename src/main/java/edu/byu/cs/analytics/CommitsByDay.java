/**
 * Contains the results of a commit analytics parse,
 * including the parameters used to generate it.
 * <br>
 * This data structure is stored alongside every {@link edu.byu.cs.model.Submission} entry.
 * Therefore, this data model is more concerned about stringified storage space and use in
 * back-end detection of errors than in user presentation. Presenting the information contained
 * within will likely require converting the data into a more friendly format.
 *
 * @param dayMap Represents each of the calendar days,
 *               with the number of commits on that day.
 * @param linearizedCommits The linearized order of all commits evaluated where earlier commits appear sooner.
 *                          This order generally corresponds to author time, but may not match exactly
 *                          when branches and merging occurs.
 * @param linearizedLineChanges A corresponding list to {@link CommitsByDay#linearizedCommits()} which provides
 *                              a single number for every commit representing the number of line changes.
 *                              If the line changes for some commit were never computed, it will be included
 *                              with the value of <b>-1</b>.
 * @param erroringCommits Reports commit hashes that triggered any of the failure conditions,
 *                        grouped by a natural key into the kinds of conditions that they failed.
 *                        This will be empty when there are no erroring commits.
 * @param totalCommits The total number of commits processed, excluding merge commits.
 * @param mergeCommits The total number of merge commits.
 * @param commitsOutOfOrder Reports whether any commits were not authored strictly after their parents.
 * @param commitsInPast Reports whether any commits were found before the tail hash chronologically.
 *                      This flag has been deemed unhelpful and intentionally ignored.
 *                      Therefore, these are NOT counted as erroring commits.
 * @param commitsInFuture Reports whether any commits were found after the end point chronologically.
 * @param commitsBackdated Reports whether any commit was detected to have been backdated.
 * @param commitTimestampsDuplicated Reports where any two commits were discovered to have the same timestamp.
 * @param missingTailHash Reports when a tail hash was expected to exist, but the commit could not be found.
 * @param lowerThreshold The {@link CommitThreshold}, exclusive.
 * @param upperThreshold The {@link CommitThreshold}, inclusive.

   â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ controller                        HTTP endpoints. In chess we would usually call this a "handler" but Paul initially called them "controller"'s (before they were split from services) and nobody ever changed it

   â”‚     â”‚     â”œâ”€ stores                      Caches items like app config and past submissions so they don't need to be retreived again the next time they're needed 
   â”‚     â”‚     â”œâ”€ types                       Typescript type definitions (similar to 'model' in the backend)

   â”‚        â””â”€ pom                            Chess project pom files. These are used for replacing poms in student repos in case they added extra dependencies.
   â””â”€ test
      â””â”€ java
         â”œâ”€ edu.byu.cs                        Basic unit tests for the backend systems. Generally the package path is the same as the class it's testing (e.g. the tests for src/main/java/edu/byu/cs/autograder/score/Scorer.java are in src/test/java/edu/byu/cs/autograder/score/ScorerTest.java) 
         â””â”€ integration                       Larger integration tests for backend systems
```

## Deployment

Before running the server, the `src/main/resources/frontend/.env.dev` configuration file needs to match your
environment (the default may be sufficient). It should contain the URL of the backend.

### Docker

For a docker deployment, run one of the following commands:

```bash
# For a deployment with a MySQL database included
docker compose --profile with-db up -d
```

```bash
# For a deployment requiring an external MySQL database
docker compose up -d
```
